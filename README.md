# Does the development of mental models for time influence memory for time?

Although we cannot see or touch time, across many cultures, we use spatial representations to think about this abstract concept. Spatial representations of time are thought to support temporal concepts that might otherwise be difficult to represent and reason about, such as remembering the order in which events happened. Here, we explored how individual differences in the development of American childrenâ€™s mental representations of time relate to their memory for temporal order. Our results suggest that the development of linear representations support the development of temporal memory.

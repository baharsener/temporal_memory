# Does the development of mental models for time influence memory for time?

Although we cannot see or touch time, across many cultures, we use spatial representations to think about this abstract concept. Spatial representations of time are thought to support temporal concepts that might otherwise be difficult to represent and reason about, such as remembering the order in which events happened. Adults and older children from many cultures spontaneously activate the mental timeline when remembering the order of events. However, the mental timeline develops slowly throughout early childhood as children gain increasing experience with formal schooling and cultural artifacts. Here, we explored how individual differences in the development of American childrenâ€™s mental timelines relate to their memory for temporal order (N = 96, Mage = 6.22 years). Our results suggest that the development of the mental timeline may support the development of temporal memory.
